# HORISEON SEO Refactor Challenge

## Description

This wepage's code was debugged and restructured in order to make the page more accessbile. This webpage was built in order to build my skills with using HTML and CSS. The issues within the code were solved by fixing the link for the search engine optimization link. The challenge allowed for the coder to grasp a better understanding of how to find breaks within a code, debug it, reorgnaize a CSS spreadsheet to make it easier to understand.
